CSS: Specificity and Cascade
    Specificity is based on Cascading algo in the 
    same type of selctors then the last one will be applied
    when the selectors are different then Specificity comes in picture
        inline css > id > class or attribute selctor > element > universal selctor
        specific calculation in website/ code in github
        orgin
        important (they will override the inline css also)
    
    attribute selctor in code

Whenver there are complex selectors like h1.yellow.p.red :  addd all
